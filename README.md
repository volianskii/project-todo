Todo App.
Tech stack: TypeScript, React, Redux.

The application allows you to create tasks and place them in one of 3 sections. Each section describes the corresponding task status: backlog, work in progress, completed.
Changing the status of "backlog" to the status of "done" is handled either by using a checkbox or by using the "drag and drop" feature. Switching between "work in progress" status and others is handled by the "drag and drop" feature.
The number of completed tasks is calculated and displayed at the bottom of the backlog section.
The user can delete tasks by clicking on the "Delete" button.

The current version is for offline usage.
